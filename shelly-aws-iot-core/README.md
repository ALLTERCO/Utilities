# AWS IoT Core and Shelly Device Setup Script

This README provides detailed information on the Bash script designed to automate the setup of AWS IoT Core and Shelly devices. The script is divided into three main phases:

- **[Phase 1: AWS CLI Setup](#phase-1-aws-cli-setup)**

- **[Phase 2: AWS IoT Core Setup](#phase-2-aws-iot-core-setup)**

- **[Phase 3: Shelly Device Setup](#phase-3-shelly-device-setup)**

Each phase is meticulously crafted to guide you through the necessary steps, ensuring a seamless setup process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu Linux or any Debian-based distribution.
- **User Privileges**: Root or sudo privileges are required.
- **Internet Connection**: Stable internet connection for downloading packages and communicating with AWS services.
- **AWS Account**: An active AWS account with permissions to manage IoT Core resources.
- **Shelly Device**: A Shelly device connected to the same network as the machine running the script.

---

## Required AWS Permissions

The script requires AWS permissions to create IoT Core resources. Ensure your AWS user or role has the following permissions:

- `iot:CreateThing`
- `iot:CreatePolicy`
- `iot:CreateKeysAndCertificate`
- `iot:AttachThingPrincipal`
- `iot:AttachPolicy`
- `iot:DescribeEndpoint`

---

## Script Execution

To execute the script:

1. **Clone or Download the Script**: Ensure the script is saved locally and has execute permissions.

   ```bash
   chmod +x shelly-aws-provision.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script with Root Privileges:**

   ```bash
   sudo ./shelly-aws-provision.sh
   ```

---

## **Phase 1: AWS CLI Setup**

### 1.1 Check and Install Prerequisites

The script checks for the following essential packages:

- `curl`
- `unzip`
- `python3`
- `jq`

If any are missing, the script installs them using `apt`.

### 1.2 AWS CLI Installation

- **Check Existing Installation**: Determines if AWS CLI is already installed.
- **Upgrade Option**: If an installation is detected, the script prompts whether you would like to upgrade.
  - If **Yes**, it follows the standard process:
    - **Download Directory Prompt**: Asks for a download directory (default is the current directory).
    - **Download AWS CLI**: Downloads the AWS CLI package to the specified location.
    - **Unzip and Install**: Extracts and installs or updates the AWS CLI.
    - **Clean Up**: Removes downloaded files after installation.
  - If **No**, it skips this step and moves to the next step.

### 1.3 AWS CLI Configuration

- **Authentication Method**: Offers two methods for AWS CLI configuration:
  - **SSO** (Single Sign-On)
  - **Short-term Credentials** (Access Key and Secret Key)

---

## **Phase 2: AWS IoT Core Setup**

### 2.1 Create an IoT Thing

- **Thing Types**: Lists existing Thing Types or allows the creation of a new one.
- **Create New Thing Type**: If a new Thing Type is created, it is automatically applied to the IoT Thing being set up.
- **Thing Name**: Prompts for a name for the IoT Thing.
- **Creation**: Uses AWS CLI to create the Thing with the specified or newly created Thing Type.

### 2.2 Policy Management

- **Existing Policies**: Lists available policies.
- **Policy Creation**: If no suitable policy exists, the script creates a new one with default permissions (`iot:*` on all resources).
- **New Policy Usage**: If a new policy is created, it is automatically used in the certificate attachment steps.

### 2.3 Certificate Generation and Attachment

- **Certificate Generation**: Creates a new certificate and private key.
- **Storage Location**: Certificates are stored in a directory named after the Thing at `<current_directory>/thingname-cert`.
- **Naming Convention**: The generated files are named as follows:
  - **Device Certificate**: `deviceCert_<thing_name>.pem`
  - **Private Key**: `privateKey_<thing_name>.pem`
  - **Root CA**: `rootCA.pem`
- **Root CA Download**: Downloads the Amazon Root CA1 certificate and saves it in the same directory.
- **Attachment**:
  - **Policy Attachment**: Attaches the specified policy to the certificate.
  - **Thing Attachment**: Attaches the certificate to the IoT Thing.

### 2.4 Retrieve MQTT Client Information

Provides essential MQTT connection details:

- **Endpoint URL**
- **Client ID** (Thing Name)
- **Paths to Certificates and Keys**

---

## **Phase 3: Shelly Device Setup**

### 3.1 Provide Shelly Device IP

Prompts for the IP address of the Shelly device and verifies connectivity.

### 3.2 Firmware Check and Update

- **Version Check**: Ensures the device firmware is at least version `1.4.2`.
- **Update Process**: If outdated, the script initiates a firmware update.

### 3.3 Upload Certificates to Shelly Device

Uploads the following to the Shelly device:

- **`CA Certificate`**
- **`Device Certificate`**
- **`Private Key`**

### 3.4 Configure MQTT on Shelly Device

Configures the Shelly device to connect to AWS IoT Core via MQTT over TLS:

- **`Server Endpoint`**
- **`Client ID`**
- **`SSL/TLS Settings`**

### 3.5 Reboot Shelly Device

Reboots the Shelly device to apply the new configurations.

## Notes and Best Practices

- **Security**: The script generates policies with full permissions (iot:*). In production, restrict permissions according to the principle of least privilege.
- **AWS CLI Configuration**: Ensure the AWS CLI is configured with credentials that have the necessary permissions for IoT Core operations.
- **Shelly Device**: Verify that the device is accessible over the network and that no firewall rules block communication.
- **Data Backup**: Always back up important data before running scripts that modify system configurations.
- **Testing**: Test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it in a production setting.
